# 📊 Sales Data Visualization using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on transforming raw sales data into meaningful insights using data visualization techniques. 
The goal is to understand sales performance, trends over time, and category-wise contribution through clear and 
interactive visual representations.

This project was developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Analytics Internship – Task 3 (Data Visualization)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Convert raw CSV data into visual insights
- Analyze sales trends and patterns
- Compare product and category performance
- Build professional visualizations for decision-making
- Gain hands-on experience with Python data analytics tools

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** – Programming language
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Basic data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Advanced statistical visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development environment

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset (`sales.csv`) contains sales records with the following fields:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Date | Date of sale |
| Product | Product name |
| Category | Product category |
| Sales | Sales amount |
| Profit | Profit earned |

The dataset is small and clean, making it ideal for beginner-level data visualization.

## 📊 Visualizations Implemented

### 1️⃣ Bar Chart – Product-wise Sales
- Compares sales performance of different products
- Helps identify top-selling and low-performing products

### 2️⃣ Line Chart – Sales Trend Over Time
- Shows how sales change across dates
- Useful for identifying peaks, drops, and patterns

### 3️⃣ Pie Chart – Category-wise Sales Distribution
- Displays percentage contribution of each category
- Highlights dominant business segments

### 4️⃣ Heatmap – Category vs Product Sales
- Shows relationship between product and category
- Uses color intensity to represent sales volume
- Helps quickly identify high and low performing combinations

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Electronics category contributes the highest share of total sales.
- Laptop is the best-performing product.
- Sales peaked on **January 2nd** and dropped sharply on **January 3rd**.
- Clothing category shows moderate and stable sales.
- Accessories have the lowest contribution to overall revenue.

## ✅ Results
The project successfully demonstrates how data visualization can:
- Simplify complex data
- Reveal hidden patterns
- Support data-driven decision making
- Improve business understanding through visuals

---

## 📈 Learning Outcomes
